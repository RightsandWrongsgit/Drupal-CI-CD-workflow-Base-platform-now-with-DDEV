description: 'develop is git branched off of staged which is git branched off of main.  This develop environment is the one you will have on the host but will interact with its local counter part in Lando as you work on your project and git stage/commit/sync between them. local and develop environment splits are pretty close to identical; the exception in our overview table is the stage_file_proxy module which we can us to limit how much of the database content we are sharing between local and host to achieve better performance without having to constantly moves copies of everything.'
